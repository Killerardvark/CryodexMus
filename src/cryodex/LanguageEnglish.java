A special thanks to Chad Hoefle and Anthony Lullig for their encouragement and testing during that time.

My goal is to have a program that #1 follows the rules and #2 is easy to use. You are welcome to contact me with any comments or concerns you have about the program. My email is Chris.Brown.SPE@gmail.com. You can also use that email to send a donation via Paypal if you feel so inclined.";
